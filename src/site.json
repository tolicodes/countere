Its remote location and extraterrestrial-seeming origin immediately garnered worldwide headlines.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Mark Santamaria and his buddy Holden were the first outsiders to visit the Monolith. They were road tripping in Utah when they learned a biological surveyor team had spotted the mysterious object. After the Utah Department of Public Safety <a href=\"https://dpsnews.utah.gov/dps-aero-bureau-encounters-monolith-in-red-rock-country/\">released videos</a> of the Monolith on Monday, November 23, a group of internet sleuths pinpointed the coordinates quickly. Mark and his buddy Holden were there the very next morning\u2014the first ones to arrive on scene.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">After Mark arrived, a helicopter full of YouTubers touched down. Federal agents showed up. And yes, his buddy Holden planked on the Monolith. Mark gave Countere the full, wild rundown of the first day the public visited the Utah Monolith.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Thanks for speaking to Countere, Mark. Let\u2019s start at the beginning.</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So I\u2019m doing a road trip with my buddy Holden right now. We were camping out in Moab, Utah\u2014riding around in a dune buggy\u2014and then the news dropped about the Monolith appearing in Utah.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So I did some digging online. And I found the actual latitude and longitude coordinates <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahMonolith/comments/k07t1u/after_only_a_day_it_would_appear_that_our_group/\">on Reddit.</a> I punched them into Google Maps and it was only 2 hours away.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was about 10 pm on Monday. So I said to my buddy Holden\u2014\u2018Do you want to see this thing? We\u2019ll probably be one of the first people there.\u2019 We left Moab first thing next morning.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Monolith is definitely not the most accessible. It\u2019s in BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land. You have to go off a highway onto a dirt road with lots of rocks, very treacherous. We have trucks with 4x4 but it was my first time doing serious off-roading and I didn\u2019t know if my truck was going to make it\u2026but the call of the Monolith had us.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When we got close to the Monolith, we lost service. It was a complete dead zone. We were in two trucks but we had walkie-talkies. We got closer and closer and I could see these giant red rocks to our left. I had studied Google Maps and I knew the Monolith was behind those rocks. I spoke into the walkie-talkie: \u201CThe Monolith is right there.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We parked my buddy Holden\u2019s car about a half-mile from the Monolith. We hopped out and started walking through this terrain\u2014a couple gullies and gorges where you had to go down sheer rock. I started noticing there\u2019s sand all around. I looked and didn\u2019t see any other footprints and I was like \u2018Cool, we\u2019re the first ones here.\u201D </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We finally climb over this one set of rocks. I look below into the gully and down at the very end I see it. This little sliver of silver sticking directly out of the ground. I got very excited and started to run. \u2018I found it! We did it!\u2019</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We reached the Monolith at about 1:30 pm on Tuesday, November 24th. We just took it in for a while\u2014observing its architecture and how it was built\u2014in silence before snapping pictures. </p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606662066764_19151\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bd7de18c5c478e6d9cab/1606664174130/utah-monolith-untouched.jpeg\" alt=\"The Monolith from a distance.\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bd7de18c5c478e6d9cab/1606664174130/utah-monolith-untouched.jpeg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bd7de18c5c478e6d9cab/1606664174130/utah-monolith-untouched.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"The Monolith from a distance.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fc3bd7de18c5c478e6d9cab\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"sqsrte-large\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Monolith from a distance.</p></div>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606662066764_19477\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>How was it built?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The monolith is triangular. You could see these cuts in the rock that were made with a concrete saw to set it into the ground. I don\u2019t know how deep the structure goes beneath the surface of the rock, but it was in there there pretty well. It was about 12 feet tall, 3-sided. The surface was some kind of brushed\u2014not very shiny\u2014sheet metal. Each corner was lined with what my buddy called \u2018cherry rivets,\u2019 little rivets.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Is it hollow inside?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I think so. We tapped on it. A guy who arrived later\u2014a YouTuber who arrived on helicopter\u2014thinks it was supported by gussets on the inside.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Did it seem like anyone had been at the Monolith before you?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I have to wonder if this thing had to have been known to a select group of people for years. There are a lot of theories about where it came from\u2014some artist put it up, an artist put it up in commemoration of another artist. If you look on Google Maps, it seems to have appeared between 2015 and 2016. But the BLM put out a statement that for all we know, this thing could have been here for 60 years.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What\u2019s the energy of the Monolith in-person?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s certainly out of place. From a distance, it had an eerie kind of feel to it\u2014almost imposing. When you see this shard of sliver sticking out of the rock in a gully, you\u2019re like \u2018What the hell is this? Is this alien? From another world\u2019?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When you get closer and observe it, you can see how manmade it is. Someone planned this out. They very obviously chose the place very specifically, and I came to appreciate the Monolith as a fascinating and mysterious piece of artwork.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Did other people start showing up?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yeah. We chilled for about an hour, climbing on rock and looking at it from different angles. It\u2019s really quiet out there.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I went back to my car to get some water. Up the road come two other vehicles, a white Jeep and a big truck that says BLM. They stop and I ask them \u2018You here to see the Monolith?\u2019 They say \u2018Yeah. We\u2019re with the government.\u2019 And I start to hear a helicopter overhead.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This shit is getting serious. As I walk back up to the Monolith, the helicopter lands on the red rocks just above it. And out hops 4-5 guys in their thirties, all with their phones out, recording themselves and talking into their phones. I was like, \u2018What the hell.\u2019 One of the guys comes up and asks me \u2018Were you the first ones here?\u2019 I said \u2018Yeah, I think so.\u2019 So he started asking me questions <a href=\"https://youtu.be/U63zicCAQIk\">for YouTube.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then the people from the BLM walk up. There were about 6 of them: a ranger, a land manager, an archeologist, a soil scientist, and so forth. They came to evaluate this thing. It was their first time laying eyes on it.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606662066764_22484\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bdc1eaf37e3b640e4e11/1606664230644/utah-monolith-people-youtube.jpeg\" alt=\"The various groups at the Monolith.\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bdc1eaf37e3b640e4e11/1606664230644/utah-monolith-people-youtube.jpeg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fc3bdc1eaf37e3b640e4e11/1606664230644/utah-monolith-people-youtube.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"The various groups at the Monolith.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fc3bdc1eaf37e3b640e4e11\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"sqsrte-large\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The various groups at the Monolith.</p></div>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606662066764_22799\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What did the government think of it?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">They were prodding at it, trying to understand its build and architecture.

After proposing a feature on <a href=\"https://www.taolin.us/\">Tao Lin,</a> I received an email back from the general contact inbox telling me to expect the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine himself to be in touch. I wasn\u2019t quite sure who they were\u2014there were rumors I\u2019m not comfortable sharing publicly here\u2014but I was told to wait by the mailbox on the third Tuesday of September for a USPS truck carrying a postcard from San Francisco. That it would be from them.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that day I sat in my driveway. Sure enough, a Grumman Long Life van swerved down my street and dropped a letter by my feet.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There was only one sentence on the crinkled white printer paper: \u2018Ask him about <strong>[REDACTED].\u2019 </strong>Below, a signature in red unfamiliar to me. Two letters. <em>RC</em>. When I asked <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, my contact at Countere, who this was, he shrugged. \u201CI\u2019d listen to him though,\u201D he said, \u201CRC is never wrong.\u201D A week later, an interview with Tao Lin was set up.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As far as I\u2019m aware, this is one of the few phone interviews Tao\u2019s done\u2014one can\u2019t discount his appearances on the <a href=\"https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/essays/tao-lin-psychedelic-journeyman/\"><em>LA Review of Books</em></a> &amp; <em>The Paris Review</em>\u2014and I was glad to find that he was transparent and engaging. I wasn\u2019t really aware of him prior to 2020, so I had the luxury of not being nervous about speaking with him, otherwise I may have overthought what I wanted to say.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In reality, Tao has been staggeringly influential as an author. Over the course of eight books\u2014two poetry collections, one book of short stories, one novella, three novels, and one book of nonfiction\u2014he\u2019s defined the voice of the internet generation. His deadpan, detached, minimalist style should be recognizable to people who\u2019ve never read a word of his. Brett Easton Ellis called him \u201Cthe most interesting prose stylist of his generation.\u201D Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tao_lin/status/1006893468139089920?lang=en\">is a fan.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tao\u2019s next novel, <em>Leave Society, </em>drops Summer 2021. To promote it, he\u2019s been blogging on a blogspot called <a href=\"https://leavesociety.blogspot.com/\">Leave Society.</a> Tao and I talked about 9/11, anti-gravity technology, grounding, breathing, his parents, and the mysterious origins of the universe. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Hey Tao, how\u2019s it going? You\u2019re in Hawaii right now?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m doing good. I'm on the island of Oahu. I've been here since January. I was going to go to Taiwan to see my parents, but then Taiwan banned foreign visitors because of the virus. I\u2019ve stayed here since then.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>It sounds like you've been doing a good amount of traveling\u2014staying in different places over the past couple of years. </strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yeah. This year, I\u2019ve been in 6 Airbnbs in Oahu. Since July, I\u2019ve been in a rental.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Would you say that traveling has helped you stay creative from a literary perspective? Or do you find the constant traveling is kind of jarring and can interrupt a connection with a certain area?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hm. I feel kind of overwhelmed by having too much to write about, and I think living in different places contributes to that. But it also helps, because it's a good structure for writing autobiographical stuff to have these different places that I stayed at.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Was your upcoming novel, <em>Leave Society,</em> predominantly written in any one particular place? Or has the writing been spread out across your travels?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's been spread out a lot, partly because of how long I've been writing it. I started writing it in 2014. And each year since then, I've gone to Taiwan for a fourth of the year. Besides Taiwan, I\u2019ve lived in Manhattan and then three or four places outside the city.

What was the creative impetus for them to become the main subjects in your new book?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I was close to my mom growing up, until I was a teenager. Then I didn't pay much attention to either of my parents for like, 15 years, especially when I was using a lot of pharmaceutical drugs and being open about it online. My mom was really worried and would try to tell me not to take drugs, and it would upset me a lot.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And then we wouldn't talk even more because of that. But then after my previous novel, <em>Taipei</em>, I felt like I'd reached a kind of bottom with all the drugs. I also connected the drugs with a certain world\u2014a bleak one, bleak and pessimistic. And as I started thinking of myself as having reached the bottom and wanting to recover, I stopped talking to a lot of people I used to talk to. And then started talking to my parents a lot more.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Do you think other millennials have had a similar trajectory with their parents as they get older?

I haven't connected it with getting older. I've connected it with wanting to disassociate myself with a certain world\u2026that doesn't care that much about older people. I\u2019m talking partly about the world of newspapers and magazines, which I was in. Like writing stuff for <em>Vice</em> and whatever.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That kind of world puts a lot of emphasis on youth and being interested in young new things. But I feel like as people get older, they do seem to become more interested in their parents. Maybe partly it's just wanting to find something new to focus on. Because I don't feel like I can just keep writing the same thing. Partly because my editor will notice that I'm writing the same thing and push me to do something new. So my parents just seemed new\u2014something I hadn\u2019t explored before.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>There's a ton of different things right now that you're interested in.

I had just arrived for college, and I was in this dorm by Washington Square Park when it happened. But I haven\u2019t been that interested in it until 2017 when I encountered a person named Judy Wood who wrote a book titled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Towers-Evidence-Directed-Free-energy-Technology/dp/0615412564\"><em>Where Did the Towers Go?</em></a> She argued that the towers were turned into dust by a classified technology that interferes electromagnetic energy, kind of like in a microwave.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I listened to her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jC9W2vbyrs\">lecture on YouTube.</a> It\u2019s two-and-a-half hours.

And I think it could be that, because I keep encountering information that leads to 9/11 and this technology that can turn things to dust...for example, I\u2019ve been learning more about extraterrestrials. This guy, Steven Greer, who has put out a few documentaries and books, argues that since the 1950s, a secret group has had anti-gravity technologies, allowing them to build UFOs. Greer thinks these secret projects, which he calls \u2018unacknowledged special access projects,\u2019 have gotten really out of control and that they\u2019re fragmented and volatile and changing all the time. And that the same group or groups with anti-gravity also have \u2018directed energy\u2019 technology that can turn things to dust.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Man, some light bulbs are going off in my brain right now.

But I know about other government-related secrets projects. I\u2019ve studied a lot about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758989641/the-cias-secret-quest-for-mind-control-torture-lsd-and-a-poisoner-in-chief\">MKULTRA.</a> Which is this thing the CIA had in the 1950s and probably still exists in various forms.

Look at all the people who spend all their time writing about the shadow government or 9/11\u2014I think those people are more of a threat.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I don\u2019t want to become a threat to these organizations. I want to focus on writing that is more personal and emotional. Partly because it seems hellish\u2026people who\u2019ve become a threat to the group with anti-gravity and other technologies, like free energy, seem to get attacked with electromagnetic energy and subjected to psychotronics and end up seeming to kill themselves or just dying. It doesn\u2019t seem like something I want to go into currently.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>When you said that <em>Leave Society</em> is a threat to everyone, including yourself, what did you mean by that? Is that just a metaphor?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I wanted it to be a threat then, because I was considering moving back to around New York City, but now I don't think of it as a threat anymore, after working on the novel more. Now I view it more as a gentle suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Is that suggestion an endorsement of pastoral life?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I think it's more of a suggestion to go in a certain direction. In my novel, I talk about how 6,500 years ago, the mainstream of humanity seems to have changed and become what Riane Eisler calls a \u2018dominator society.\u2019 It became male-dominated and obsessed with war and detached from nature. So when I say \u2018society,\u2019 I\u2019m referring to what I argue has only been in effect for 6,500 years. I mean just to go away from that, to any degree.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The main character in the novel, Li, talks about how since he lives in midtown Manhattan, and has grown up being immersed in this society, he feels that anything he does will be qualified as leaving society to some degree.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605279629073_14462\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1992.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:111.39558410644531%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5faea23f44e8212553d2db55/1605280838538/tao-lin-countere-interview\" alt=\"tao-lin-countere-interview\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5faea23f44e8212553d2db55/1605280838538/tao-lin-countere-interview\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5faea23f44e8212553d2db55/1605280838538/tao-lin-countere-interview\" data-image-dimensions=\"1992x2219\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"tao-lin-countere-interview\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5faea23f44e8212553d2db55\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605279629073_14751\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>I think you may be referencing the fact that the world isn't necessarily even 10 billion years old or however long people say it is, but actually much, much, much older. And this \u2018dominator society\u2019 thinks it was the oldest, but we have a human history that we need to tap into. To resurrect our true human selves.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I think you summarized it well.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>When it comes to the Big Bang and how people conceive of the world\u2019s beginning, we both know that's a factually wrong place to start because our essence has been along before the Big Bang ever occurred. What are your thoughts on how the Big Bang is marketed in modern society?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I read this book earlier this year called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Never-Happened-Refutation/dp/067974049X\"><em>The Big Bang Never Happened.</em></a><em> </em>The author, Eric Lerner, gives a lot of evidence for why the Big Bang doesn't seem accurate. He talks about why he thinks the Big Bang got so popular. He points out that the Big Bang was first proposed by Edgar Allan Poe in like 1868. And he thinks it got really popular throughout the 20th century because of how bleak things have been with the two World Wars.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Big Bang postulates that either everything's going to keep expanding until it\u2019s extremely cold and things are far apart and there\u2019s no life, or that everything's going to crunch back down and be destroyed. Eric Lerner thinks those options are comforting to people of the 21st century, who are existential and think things are meaningless.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s similar to what I was talking about with the dominator society 6,500 years ago. Because one of the main alternative theories to the Big Bang\u2014called \u2018plasma cosmology\u2019\u2014says that the universe is at least a few trillion years old, and possibly infinite in space and time. So the lesser-known theory in our society offers the much bigger, more complex world than the dominant theories of the Big Bang or that civilization didn\u2019t start until 6,500 years ago. So these less known theories make things more complex, and at the same time, it seems to me, more accurate. And, to me, they also make the world seem more magical and hopeful\u2014that it\u2019s possibly way, way older, and that humans seem to have been, from like 300,000 to 6,500 years ago, a \u2018partnership\u2019 species, with people worshipping nature and living without war. So that's one way those two theories are connected in my book.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>How did you envision <em>Leave Society </em>when you started, and how has the final result aligned with your expectations?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hm. I haven't thought about that. I had the title since the very beginning. And I had a kind of feeling. But the thing with this book is that I wrote it while living it over at least four years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>You\u2019ve got a lot of different styles.

How have your styles changed over time?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I feel like they keep changing from book to book. Right now, if I just started typing something, I don\u2019t feel like it will be a certain style. It feels like information, which I edit into a certain style. I\u2019ve tried different styles, like the ones you mentioned and\u2026I would be interested in using those styles again. So, I don't feel like I'm evolving somewhere with my style, but more like I'm open to using whatever style.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Would you say there is a deliberate style choice to <em>Leave Society</em>?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yeah, there is. I liked the style throughout each of my books to be the same. And that happens when I keep editing it. With this book, I kept going from beginning to end, reading and editing. The style was informed by me wanting it to be really readable\u2014to be clear and to use simple language. But also have variety and to be dense and complex sometimes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>I've got a couple more things here, words that I must ask while I have you. I\u2019ve seen you mention grounding. I thought it was pretty interesting\u2014the ground being able to catch free radicals, and how our lack of connection to the ground with our feet has impacted our rates of cancer. When did you first hear about grounding?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I don\u2019t remember where I first heard it, but I\u2019ve heard it probably like a hundred times since college from people interested in natural health and and people interested in optimizing their body. It seems to be just that you can absorb electrons through your feet from the Earth. When people say that they're inflamed, that means they\u2019re lacking electrons.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So when I walk bare feet on a beach or somewhere, I\u2019m aware of that sometimes, and it helps me enjoy it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>It gets back to what you were saying with the purpose of the book <em>Leave Society</em>.

And I've heard various other people talking about breathing more being good.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then I encountered this book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breathe-Heal-Asthma-Breathing-Normalization-ebook/dp/B01J0SC1XQ\"><em>Breathe to Heal</em></a><em>, </em>and it talks about how almost everyone today breathes too much. It was convincing. The author talks about how aboriginal people breathe slowly and calmly through the nose, and so do other experts in breathing like yogis and samurais. And he talks about how breathing through the nose is healthier. It filters the air, it warms the air and lets the air pass through all of your sinuses, which go all the way up to your eyes. It seems that humans have evolved with this breathing through the nose slowly. So I\u2019ve been doing that, I've been breathing through the nose, and I think it's helped me with my mood and sleep and level of calmness.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>I know <em>Leave Society</em> is your newest book, but you've also hinted at another forthcoming book.</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Apocalypse Training. </em>Yes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>I think it's an appropriate title.

You could say the same about the two gentlemen sitting on the stage with a large mural reading \u2018Culture War\u2019 behind them\u2014both holding a microphone with Star Spangled Smiles etched across their faces.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sitting stage right was Rob Smith, a gay black man who is the spokesperson for TPUSA. To his right, stage left, was pro-Trump wonderkid Charlie Kirk\u2014a figure who has arguably become the posterchild for the next generation of American conservatives.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As the Q&amp;A portion of the event neared, one might have noticed a motley crew of Pepe-the-frog-inspired men\u2014<em>saboteurs\u2014</em>skulking behind the audience microphones. They had specific instructions in their head, downloaded over the internet. These men have developed a cultural camouflage where they meld into their surroundings\u2014dressing professionally, maintaining neat hair, and achieving a kind of anonymity\u2014until the time is right to strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Such was the case with one young man who made his way up to the microphone. Dressed in a suit and tie, rosary in hand, he<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xLgp2MyNco&amp;ab_channel=AlbertoZambrano\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=AlbertoZambrano&amp;v=4xLgp2MyNco\">asked</a> Kirk and Smith: \u201C[Because of] E. Michael Jones\u2019 groundbreaking work, we now understand that sexual liberation is [a form of] political control. And you have, multiple times, advocated on behalf of accepting homosexuality in the conservative movement\u2014how does anal sex help us win the culture war?\u201D&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What was supposed to be a serious event turned into an ocean of giggles and laughs. Smith\u2019s response was thus: \u201CThis is America. This is the greatest freaking nation in the world. We realize that America is great because we have Western values. We realize that gays and lesbians are able to contribute to American society in the same way that everybody else is.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A good answer, but the questions kept coming. \u201CGiven that your interpretation of traditional conservative values stems from 1965 on immigration, and 2015 on race, I\u2019d like to know how long do we have to wait until child drag shows are pushed as traditional American conservatives?\u201D \u201CIn the wake of the student debt crisis, how is regurgitating this far-left talking point of stapling green cards to diplomas \u2018America First\u2019?\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another young man, wearing a blazer and Make America Great Again hat, stepped up to the microphone. \u201CAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, population projections in 2045, whites will account for less than 50 percent of the population across the United States,\u201D he read from his smartphone. \u201CGiven that most groups other than whites overwhelmingly vote Democrat, how can we be sure that American ideals will be maintained when millions of immigrants come in with majority Democratic support? Can you prove that our white European ideals will be maintained if [the country] is not made up of white European descendants?\u201D&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block video-block sqs-block-video\" data-block-json=\"&#123;&quot;blockAnimation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;caption-hidden&quot;,&quot;overlay&quot;:false,&quot;description&quot;:&#123;&quot;html&quot;:&quot;Groyper uprising at TPUSA Ohio State event.&quot;&#125;,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;iframe src=\\&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ER0PdBgSPzE?feature=emb_title&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1\\&quot; height=\\&quot;480\\&quot; width=\\&quot;854\\&quot; scrolling=\\&quot;no\\&quot; frameborder=\\&quot;0\\&quot; allowfullscreen=\\&quot;\\&quot;&gt;\\n&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER0PdBgSPzE&amp;feature=emb_title&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:854,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;thumbnailUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ER0PdBgSPzE/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;&#125;\" data-block-type=\"32\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697944933_8486\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><div class=\"intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:100%\"><div class=\"embed-block-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.20609%;\"><div class=\"sqs-video-wrapper\" data-html=\"&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ER0PdBgSPzE?feature=emb_title&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; width=&quot;854&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;/iframe&gt;\" data-provider-name=\"YouTube\"></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697944933_8550\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">These questions\u2014which, contrary to the media\u2019s narrative about the Right, are still extremely controversial for conservatives to ask\u2014get to the heart of what these young men and their \u2018Groyper Army\u2019 believe. Led by its 22-year-old crown prince, Nick Fuentes, the Groyper movement has garnered a reputation as a faceless collective of Internet trolls who harbor white nationalist and anti-Semitic sentiments. The Groypers surged in 2017 after President Donald Trump took office\u2014a presidential candidate the Internet collective believed best represented their values. For anyone invested in the future of the American Right, the Groypers may be the most important group in the country to watch.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What Do the Groypers Believe?</strong></h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The question of what the Groypers really believe is the key to understanding why they are so notorious for trolling and picking fights with other conservatives. While the Groypers have no quarrels in taking digs at pink-haired progressives, they view the left, in large part, as not worth criticizing\u2014a party that, in a phrase, is <em>irredeemable</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Groypers are primarily concerned with the conservative party and its future. They spurn the neoconservatism of Reagan and Bush and instead long to resurrect the \u2018paleoconservatism\u2019 of Robert Taft, Paul Gottfried, Pat Buchanan, and Samuel T. Francis\u2014the days where tradition, order, and discipline were the mainstay of the right. Paleoconservatism lost its foothold in the 50s, with its last iteration involving Pat Buchanan losing to George H.W. Bush in the 1992 Republican presidential primaries by a staggering seven million votes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What makes the Groypers richly complicated and intriguing is that they are mostly Zoomers\u2014young adults who were born after 9/11. These are not geriatrics wishing to go back to the good ol\u2019 days but young people, often teenagers, who want to see a change in a country they believe has gone off the rails. They are attempting to bring extreme anti-immigration policies back into the Overton window of acceptable thought, as well as Catholic principles deeply suspicious of social change. In this way, the Groypers are firmly grounded in a reactionary philosophy.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Groypers aren\u2019t organized in a formal fashion.

The Groypers, conversely, are specific in their ideas, which are often in direct opposition to prominent \u2018young conservatives\u2019 like Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The three primary issues the Groypers focus on are thus:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Mass immigration</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Upholding Catholic values</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Maintaining a white majority in the U.S.A.</p></li></ul><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Immigration, Demographics and the Question of Race</strong></h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Perhaps the most significant and controversial point Fuentes and the Groypers uphold is the idea that all immigration should be cut off in the United States for the foreseeable future. It does not matter to them if someone is coming from Europe or Africa\u2014they say that the U.S. has allowed too many people into the country, which has caused a number of socio-political issues they claim will lead to the degeneracy of the U.S.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Despite the collective\u2019s indiscriminate support for a ban on all immigration, including from Europe, this position has often been associated with white supremacy and white nationalism. While Fuentes has expressed his belief that the U.S. should maintain its supermajority of white people, he does not believe minorities born in the U.S. should be thrown out of the country in order to bring this about. The Groypers believe that it is crucial to retain the European ideals that the U.S. was founded upon, and that minorities and immigrants should work to assimilate into the European mold that has existed in North America for several hundred years.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes\u2019 July 17, 2019 Telegram post sums up his position more crassly: \u201CWe are importing ungrateful people who couldn\u2019t make their own countries work by the millions and they do nothing but denigrate our ancestors and history with both their hands out\u2026this is what Trumpism should look like btw time to kick it up a notch.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Of course, Fuentes been called a racist, white nationalist, and white supremacist. He plays on the accusations, selling shirts on his website that read \u2018Nickers.\u2019&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In an interview with fellow firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, Fuentes insisted that he was not a racialist but that he had a problem with people pretending that race didn\u2019t play a part in building a culture at all. He added that he is against interracial marriage, saying that there is \u201Cnothing wrong\u201D with wanting \u201Cmy children\u201D to look like me. (It\u2019s worth noting that Fuentes\u2019 father is Mexican and he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickjfuentes/status/1114235693545472000?lang=en\">is of mixed-race Hispanic ancestry.)</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In believing the stability and success of the United States relies on a supermajority of white people and a predominant Anglo-American culture, the Groypers could fairly be described as \u2018white nationalists.\u2019 The Groypers are profoundly white in their perspective (European)\u2014I personally have never seen a non-white Groyper, though there are female Jewish Groypers like <a href=\"https://antisj.fandom.com/wiki/Ashley_Rae_Goldenberg\">Ashley Rae Goldenberg</a>\u2014but do not officially call for deportation of or violence against other groups. \u201CWe are not the [alt-right],\u201D Fuentes has written. \u201CThe alt-right was a racialist, atheist, post-American, revolutionary and transnational movement. American First is a traditionalist, Christian, conservative, reformist, American Nationalist Movement.\u201D</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Turning the Tide of the Conservative Party</strong></h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes and the Groypers see the current conservative party too often playing the political game by the progressive\u2019s rules. This is why the unnamed Groyper asked Smith and Kirk what anal sex had to do with winning the culture war. The Groypers are, generally speaking, Catholics, meaning that they believe homosexuality to be a sin before God.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes and the Groypers have coined the phrase \u2018Conservative Inc.\u2019 to designate what they perceive to be the morally bankrupt conservative movement in America. The term Conservative Inc. is used as a way to jab at mainstream conservatives for behaving much like a corporation, where they do not emphasize the traditional values of the conservative movement so much as they care about economics and \u2018the market.\u2019&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes has refined this position by saying that America has lost its way in terms of religious commitment. He holds that the virtues of discipline and order are crumbling, in part, due to an abandonment of religious devotion. Fuentes has expressed that he does not drink alcohol and has never had sex before, believing the latter is reserved for marriage.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697944933_13021\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1280.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5c019d0533b062ee628ee/1604850138250/fuentes-show-immigration.jpeg\" alt=\"Fuentes discussing immigration on his show.\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5c019d0533b062ee628ee/1604850138250/fuentes-show-immigration.jpeg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5c019d0533b062ee628ee/1604850138250/fuentes-show-immigration.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1280x720\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Fuentes discussing immigration on his show.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa5c019d0533b062ee628ee\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"sqsrte-large\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes discussing immigration on his show.</p></div>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697944933_13310\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes does not only break with the sharp-dressed members of Conservative Inc. (though he is sharp-dressed himself), he also takes issue with the brand of conservatism so prevalent in the American South, where the concept of freedom is paramount. He holds to the view that authentic freedom is only possible within a system that puts a premium on discipline and order. This plays into Fuentes\u2019 belief that Protestants have effectively spearheaded the disintegration of discipline and commitment historically valued in the Christian faith.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While Fuentes and many of the Groypers may superficially appear in the media as devoted members of the conservative party, their mascot of Pepe the Frog is a signal that they have taken on the role of the subversive\u2014a dissident branch within the right. The Groypers believe they are separating the wheat from the chaff in the hopes that a polished paleoconservative movement might emerge with the rise of the Zoomer generation.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Are the Groypers Anti-Semitic?</strong></h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Groypers have been charged with anti-Semitism on a number of occasions. One such reason is due to a joke Fuentes uttered on his show, <em>America First, </em>where he questioned how many ovens it would take to bake 6 million cookies. Fuentes concluded that the number of cookies baked would be closer to 2 or 3 hundred thousand than 6 million\u2014an obvious Holocaust joke. While Fuentes\u2019s show is often littered with satire and sprinkled with meta-humor, some have taken this as confirmation that Fuentes is anti-Semitic. Jokes are intended to draw out a laugh, but there is an ounce of authentic belief beneath the punchline.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When infamous gay conservative personality Milo Yiannopoulous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=MILO&amp;v=H9Rtr922ENg\">invited</a> Fuentes onto his show, he brought up the Holocaust joke first. Yiannopolous played the clip on his show before comically picking up a tray of cookies in the studio and asking Fuentes how many cookies there were on the tray. Fuentes ruminated for a moment before saying that he knew \u201Cthat there is the one correct answer that media expects from me,\u201D sending Yiannopolous into a pseudo-frustrated fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuentes carried on by taking the opportunity on the show to say that he is not anti-Semitic, though he does find problems with the Jewish community, especially when it comes to foreign policy. Fuentes noted that he believed Zionists and those sympathetic to the cause simply hold too much political sway in the U.S. State Department. He continued by explaining that the U.S. recently gave Israel a record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-israel-sign-new-38-billion-military-aid-deal-biggest-ever/\">38 billion</a> dollars, and has given more money to Israel than any other country <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_relations#:~:text=Since%201985%2C%20the%20United%20States,adjusted)%20since%20World%20War%20II.\">since 1978.</a> The Groypers\u2019 anti-Israel position marks another serious break with the conservative establishment.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">One could go on forever about wicked barbs or offensive jokes Fuentes has made, and in journalistic fairness, <a href=\"https://www.irehr.org/reports/alt-right-to-groyper/\">here\u2019s a link</a> for the Institute for Research &amp; Education on Human Rights\u2019 full report on the Groypers. Keep in mind, though, that organization has their own left-wing bias: in their report, they cite Charlie Kirk\u2019s quote saying \u201CScience is quite clear, we are all human beings. Race is made up. Stop using it\u201D as evidence of him \u201Cbolstering white supremacy\u201D (which is true\u2026only if you subscribe to critical race theory).</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Final Word</strong></h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It appears to me that Fuentes and the Groypers are here to stay.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The difficulty in finding just how many Groypers there are is compounded by their ability to remain anonymous. They are indiscernible in day-to-day life. Members of the collective are not necessarily walking around with MAGA hats or flying American flags from their pickup trucks. These are very possibly people who sit around with their friends, opting out of every political discussion that happens to manifest, just waiting until they can get home to unleash their thoughts in Super Chats, 4Chan, and other online forums.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">One way to see the Groypers is as an inversion of the Left. Young woke leftists are obsessed with tribal identity, radical change, and dismantling the classical liberal ideals of their parents. Their Groyper counterparts share the same goals, but from a white, male, and Catholic perspective. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This renewed commitment to Christianity by young Americans could also be a sign that the postmodern era of irony and nihilism are on their way out the door in favor of Grand Narratives that were so prevalent before the two World Wars. Though President Donald Trump is not the Groypers\u2019 ideal candidate\u2014having, to them, been soft on immigration and failing to uphold the firm Christian values\u2014the vast majority of them (perhaps all of them) will be voting to get him re-elected in November, as he maintains, in their view, at least some semblance of discipline and order. Fuentes has criticized Trump\u2019s political moves on a number of occasions, but he will be riding the Trump Train through to the New Year, as the alternative, for him, would be an unimaginable regression into moral decay and chaos\u2014the antithesis of order.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Follow Collin Jones on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thelastsisyphus\"><strong><em>Twitter.</em></strong></a><strong><em>\uFEFF</em></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

We are constantly bombarded with useless jargon from pundits and losers who look like they haven't seen the sunlight in several months. People with bags under their eyes from never-ending leering at the blue light emitted from their computer and phone screens; their bodies loosely resembling a malnourished ghoul that crawled out from under a sink hole in a lithium-ion waste dump, held together and powered by Ritalin and iced coffee. I look at them and think\u2014what insight could these people possibly have to offer me? They are clueless! These people have no credibility, because they don\u2019t pass the most important test.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">These people don't lift. They aren\u2019t on the daily iron grind. They don't hit PR\u2019s. They haven\u2019t developed the unceasing hunger of progress like lifters have. Lifters put more weight on the bar, perform more reps, practice progressive overload\u2014this is the true progress which shriveled up laptop progressives don\u2019t understand. Lifters achieve glory time and time again. The rewards of achievement have instilled a tremendous drive in all of us. The drive that screams for us to attain physical superiority even when we don\u2019t feel our best. This same drive spills over into all aspects of our being over time, morphing us into a new entity, and we are reborn from this. The lifter metamorphosis!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For pundits or social media ghouls who don't lift, there is no such metamorphosis. These people are stagnant and out of touch. They have no real life experience, no meaningful social interaction. They\u2019ve created a skewed reality in their heads based on the endless online interactions they have in their echo-chamber, and have embraced it as if it were the real world. They\u2019ve created a fake world based on weakness and this is why they want to tear down the strong.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The soyjack psychology stems directly from their pale skin, thin limbs, and fear. Lifter psychology is built on confronting the challenges that life throws at us. We aren't told that the world should cater to us because we are suffering. We are taught that we need to get stronger. We may fail a lift time and time again, but with devotion and training, the muscles in our body grow and adapt until one day that same weight we were struggling with becomes merely a warm-up. Our minds grow and adapt with our bodies. Persistence and perseverance are the echoes we hear, the fruit of which we bear in our succulent physiques: chiseled statures and a dominant aura. The lifter ascends!</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697783468_5106\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1111.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:119.35193634033203%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5bf3e92224b6b0a5126b6/1604697926843/\" alt=\"\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5bf3e92224b6b0a5126b6/1604697926843/\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5bf3e92224b6b0a5126b6/1604697926843/\" data-image-dimensions=\"1111x1326\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa5bf3e92224b6b0a5126b6\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697783468_5395\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The opinions that lifters form are derived from their journeys in the iron temple. You can\u2019t separate mind from body. We know that life is suffering and we conquer it every day. That\u2019s what makes our opinion better and more important than the average non-lifter beta-soyjack. Those people have been coddled. They are children stuck in adult bodies. Their parents failed them. Their minds are not fully developed because their bodies are not developed at all. They have never left their comfort zone. Intellectually, they cling to their favorite childhood blankey and wail fervently at a relentless world that refused to slow down for them. Their insecurities have manifested and possessed their minds, bodies and spirits. Every single thought or idea is directly influenced by the whisper of diffidence constantly nagging them from the deep crevices of their conscience. For this they are not to be taken seriously. They want to drag as many individuals down to their level as possible. Especially lifters!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the end of the day, the strongest evidence that lifter opinions matter more really boils down to one clear and blunt litmus test: who has the better physique? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next time you want to know whether or not someone is saying something true, ask them to take their shirt off and flex. Would you rather take advice from a 10/10 Chad with a tremendous, strong physique, or a sloppy normie with zero muscle mass who struggles to get out of bed in the morning because he feels too overwhelmed? The mental gymnastics these people have to perform in order to make their soy-induced dribble seem viable is astounding. They feel as if they must trick you in order to sway your thoughts and actions. They are like salesmen, trying to sell you on an idea instead of presenting it to you in a straightforward way. While a well-stacked Chad can simply tell you what he feels is right, in the simplest of terms, and it will resonate. It will encourage. It will carry weight. Your spirit will be at peace as you hear the confidence and witness the overall demeanor in which the message is delivered. No backhanded tricks or hidden agendas to watch for, only purity and purpose.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The message is simple.

Yeah, he welcomed it and it was cool, a real down-to-earth guy and staff over there.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What is it like being a conservative in the entertainment world?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s fun. With everyone so far-left, I stand out. I think my stuff is pretty good so people, regardless of belief, will recognize my bars and maybe they\u2019ll listen and it plants a seed and in five years they will come back and think \u201CIt all make sense now!\u201D There is another pro-Trump rapper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBrysonGray\">Bryson Gray</a> and he broke down the barrier for me, because he did this first. I\u2019m just expanding on that.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m dropping an album end of October\u201428th or 29th\u2014should be ten tracks. It\u2019s 100% hip-hop. It\u2019s not necessarily a ring-wing album but has those influences. I\u2019m into politics and the right-wing so it\u2019s really about the black conservative perspective.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote null\" data-block-type=\"31\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697238786_4092\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n<figure class=\"block-animation-site-default\">\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n  >\n    <span>&#147;</span>\u201CA white girl sent an email to my own school / she tried to cancel me and slander me with old news / all because I made a joke I wasn\u2019t supposed to\u201D<span>&#148;</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption class=\"source\">&mdash; Patriot J, \"Thought Criminal\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604697238786_4157\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What happened at Pepperdine with getting reported?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">During the <a href=\"https://countere.com/home/aftermath-of-manhattan-riots\">George Floyd BLM protests</a>, I Tweeted \u201Cbrb going to change my Venmo handle to Minnesota defense fund and get the donations.\u201D This girl [got upset and] found screenshots on my private Twitter and sent them to the California Bar and my school.

It let me realize there is another side so I said, let me see what they are talking about\u2014looking at things objectively, not emotionally. I found their arguments way more convincing. I didn\u2019t gain an audience until a few months ago but I was always right-wing and made my Trump support known.

I listened to him so much that I decided I wanted to do that but add some substance to it: ignorant trap music that makes sense and makes you think a little bit. For my new projects its all Comethazine-type beats. I know my shit is unique and I\u2019m building the market for it.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

The family was poor. The father a drunk. The kids beat her up at school. The envelope had no return address. The upper left hand corner just said:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A GIFT</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Well open it, said her mother. And she did.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was a check for one million dollars.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the memo section it said \u201CYou'll Never Want Again.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The address section had no name. It just said TREEHOUSE CORPORATION.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's a prank, said the mother. Throw it away.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yes, the girl agreed. A prank. But it's funny. I like it. I'll put it in a frame.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That's ridiculous, the mother said. Why torture yourself like that.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's fine, said the girl. It's funny.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The next day she skipped school and rode her bike to the bank. Presented the check. I think this is a joke, she said. But can you check to be sure. The teller gave a half smile and went to get the manager. She took the check with her. The girl's heart picked up. There was a long moment at the window. The radio was playing Fleetwood Mac. <em>Well there you go again-- you say you want your freedom. </em>The manager came to the window. He wore a light purple shirt and a dark purple tie. He was holding the check. Are your parents outside, he asked.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No, she said. I rode my bike.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I'm going to need a parent or guardian for this situation, he said.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was real.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">**</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Her parents didn't steal the money. They bought a modest house. She went to a new school. They didn't beat her up there. She read French. She played viola. Before the school she didn't know what a viola was. She loved it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She looked for TREEHOUSE CORPORATION every day at first. Then every week. Every month, every year. But she never forgot. She went to college. Majored in journalism. Asked her professors: how could you find someone from their bank account. Treehouse Corporation was an LLC owned by an S Corp owned by another LLC in Bermuda, and so on. They didn't want to be found.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She placed little classified ads. Places where someone who owned a corporation would read it. The Financial Times. The Economist. I'm the girl from Oak Grove. You gave me a gift. It changed my life. I'd like to talk to you. Please write to me.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No one did.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She got a job at a newspaper. The Paris bureau. A girl from her town, her home. She met a man, a painter. They married in June. A boy. She would speak at night about the gift. Treehouse. Let it go, he told her. His palm on the back of her neck, kissing her hair. Let it go. It gave you a life that brought us together. It did its work. It doesn't matter anymore.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And one day there it was. In her very own paper.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A billionaire was dying. He'd built half the homes in America. He never gave interviews but now just once. He grew up poor. The father a drunk, he beat the boy. One day a kindly neighbor gave him a gift. His first ten dollars. He bought lumber. Taught himself to build. Made a place he could be safe. A treehouse.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">He had no office anymore. His mysterious foundations didn't return her calls. Marcel took the baby while she flew 20 hours. Back roads to the mansion outside Omaha. She came to the gate with the high beams from the rental car cutting into cold pouring rain just as night fell. Big black button on the old intercom. Hello, she said. Hello\u2014do you remember me. You gave me a gift.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No one answered.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Please, she said. Please\u2014I've looked for you all my life. The cold rain fell and fell. She was crying.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And a voice came.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I can't believe you've found me, a man said. Raspy and tired like waking up from a long sleep. Is there anything you'd like to tell me. And she said: can I have some more money.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>\u201CThe Gift\u201D is excerpted from Delicious Tacos\u2019 short story collection, \u201CSavage Spear of the Unicorn.\u201D Find more Delicious Tacos books on </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Delicious-Tacos/e/B07MG5GVSN%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\"><strong><em>Amazon</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

He asked God to take pity: \u201CWill you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?\u201D In the end, God told Abraham his decision was final and Gomorrah was swallowed whole by tides the size of skyscrapers. At least that\u2019s the story my rabbi used to tell me.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Other religious scholars believe that the city burned in a ball of heavenly fire. When I read the biblical passage with my rabbi, I remember asking him why God was so punitive towards his creations who gone astray\u2014why couldn\u2019t he just let those people live? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My rabbi told me that these people were accused of mass rape, homicide, and other heinous sins. Their fate was sealed. They were flawed for generations. No amount of prayer could save them. The past seven months have reaffirmed to me the harsh truth of the God of the Hebrew Bible\u2014he takes pleasure in moments of schadenfreude. He\u2019s constantly keeping us on our toes, which is why I\u2019m not surprised to see Donald Trump is now diagnosed with coronavirus.  Divine justice may be at play.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Trump supporters, along with everyone else on Earth, were understandably disturbed given the magnitude of the announcement. Some posted memes on their message boards, saying that Trump would make the Wu Flu look like a mild hangover. But Trump is known for never touching a drink. And at his age, I don\u2019t think he could handle the pain one feels after a night of twelve beers. At 24, I know I still barely can. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Still, those on the \u201Cfar-left\u201D as Trump likes to say, are giddy at the thought of Donald Trump\u2019s affliction with a fatal disease. A small few, we all know who they are\u2014\u2019The Squad\u2019\u2014probably really are celebrating Trump\u2019s diagnosis in the privacy of an iPhone group chat. But I imagine most Americans, regardless of political party, genuinely do wish him a speedy recovery. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Democrats benefit from today, no question. With Biden being confirmed negative after an initial scare, the election is Biden\u2019s to lose now. His lead has widened over the past months and since the next debate is probably going to be virtual, Trump has little chance to make any last minute effort to change the trajectory of the race. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I know my MAGA friends don\u2019t want to hear that. They like to imagine Trump as the tough guy <a href=\"https://countere.com/home/ben-garrison-interview\">Ben Garrison</a> portrays him to be, and in some ways, Trump does reflect the courage of his cartoon counterpart. But given Trump\u2019s weight\u2014which borders on the edge of obese, or at least overweight\u2014this virus may pose real trouble for him. And any impact on <a href=\"https://darkwebinsider.com/lifestyle-culture/lil-pump-amp-trump-the-internet-generation\">Donald Pump</a> himself, the self-proclaimed defender of the Free Market, puts the Free Market into doubt. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The streets are empty in New York City and Boston. People are psychologically scarred from the COVID-19 crisis\u2014the media attention, constant new reports, opinion articles, hysteria. How many months did this announcement set back our collective recovery? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We were supposed to be on the precipice of a reopening; Trump proclaimed as much at his last public rally in <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/trump-is-back-in-minnesota-to-raise-money-and-rally-supporters/572591282/\">Minneapolis</a>. Up until this morning, I believed the dream, too. The traffic in my area of Fairfield County\u2014basically a suburb of New York City that everyone flocked to as they fled\u2014had gotten to pre-coronavirus levels. I had stopped wearing my mask around. The bars still aren\u2019t open\u2014nothing is\u2014but I thought maybe, who knows, in four months I could go get plastered at the bar again. Now I think that day is at least 12 months back.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">With this announcement it is hard to imagine anyone is going to allow their Fortune 500 employees back to work. \u201CIf Trump got it, you can too\u201D is what they will say. So don\u2019t come near us, this city, or another person ever again. Stay away. Regardless whether or not people support Trump, the recent news is a reminder to them that they aren\u2019t safe. That the boogeyman exists. The great economic depression that some fear is looming may be closer than we imagined. I don\u2019t want it to be true, but at 7:39 PM, October 2, 2020, as I write this, it feels possible. The impact of the President\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis is the hammer that just nailed the coffin of America\u2019s mental recovery.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We\u2019ve seen police brutality, riots, political savagery, and an unprecedented pandemic in the span of months. The hard truth of it is that we\u2019re responsible for this. All of us. We\u2019ve acted wickedly for generations\u2014abandoned God, dehumanized our opponents, played the victim, been the oppressor. It would be hard to find just ten righteous among us.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our people right now are exhausted. Another act of this drama is more than the audience can handle. We just want to go home. But there\u2019s nowhere to go. We are never going back to normal. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Follow Seth King on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Seth_kingwriter\"><strong><em>Twitter.</em></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

One group behaves as if it is the deadliest biological agent in human history (that is, unless there is a <a href=\"https://countere.com/home/aftermath-of-manhattan-riots\">riot</a> to attend). The other group seems to doubt that there even is a virus. But nearly everyone acts as if we know everything there is to know about it. Instead of acquiring herd immunity, we have acquired herd mentality.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The public discourse has moved beyond the virus itself and includes everything COVID-19-related, except COVID-19 itself, and the important but still-unanswered questions about the virus\u2019 origins, pathology, and how we finally adopt sensible personal and public responses to it. I\u2019m writing this because there are many opportunists\u2014grifters, bureaucrats, politicians, clout-chasers, media whores\u2014on both sides who are using this situation for personal gain. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. In fact, I think they ought to be dragged out into the streets and <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> for their recklessness. Unlike them, I\u2019m not going to pretend at absolute certainty\u2014not with something that is without a doubt the weirdest acting pathogen that I\u2019ve ever seen. All I care about is that you and your people make it out on the other side okay.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">First off, people widely think of COVID-19 just in terms of respiratory symptoms. My suspicion is this is partly due to the terrifying nature of acute respiratory distress, but mainly because it\u2019s most compared with the flu. A comparison that originated in the media\u2014\u201CGet a grippe America, the Flu is a much bigger threat than Coronavirus, for now\u201D read one <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/time-for-a-reality-check-america-the-flu-is-a-much-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-for-now/2020/01/31/46a15166-4444-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html\">now-infamous headline</a> in The Washington Post\u2014and has since become something of an internet meme.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Comparing COVID-19 with the common seasonal flu is highly misleading. While influenza infection is usually localized to the lungs, COVID-19 can spread throughout the body and attack other organs. It can even attack your blood cells, creating platelet hyperactivity that results in spontaneous blood clots. Because the media and public health officials focus almost exclusively on the respiratory effects of COVID-19, too little attention is paid to fighting this disease on the other fronts. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The latest <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alice.kramer.739/posts/539468730339433\">meme going around</a> claims that the current survival rate is 98.54%. This is misleading when you consider that a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html\">New York Times report</a> found that \u201Cup to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus.\u201D On the flip side, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200526173832.htm\">analysis by Johns Hopkins</a> found that the chances of a false negative test result were \u201Cgreater than 1 in 5 on average\u201D, with 100% probability of a false negative on Day 1 and a 67% chance of a false negative on Day 4. In other words, the high number of false positives and false negatives puts an extreme skew on the data that renders the CDC infection survivability numbers completely worthless. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This also holds true for the \u20186%\u2019 statistic <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm\">from the CDC</a>\u2014that \u201Cfor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned,\u201D which is often interpreted as \u201Conly 6% of reported deaths are actually from COVID-19.\u201D What that statistic actually means is that 6% of the reported COVID-19 deaths were in patients who had no other diagnosed chronic health conditions. This might mean something if America were a healthy nation. We\u2019re not. 6 in 10 Americans have a chronic disease. 4 in 10 have <strong>two or more </strong>chronic diseases.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is the main reason why the herd immunity model would have almost certainly been a bloodbath here. We are not a Nordic country with a population of healthy, fit people. We are a country of sick people. Chronic disease is so common here that most people don\u2019t even worry about it. But the crucial distinction is that chronic diseases are not necessarily death sentences nor are they necessarily permanent. They can be beaten. I know from my own experience\u2014I went from being a junk food-addicted teenager with type 2 diabetes, high-blood pressure, and heart problems to someone who is now healthy and fit. And I also know from the experiences of people that I\u2019ve helped that remarkable transformations in health can be achieved by anyone who has the will to make it happen. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/raw-egg-nationalism\"><em>[It Is Time to Practice Raw Egg Nationalism]</em></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">COVID-19 is a threat worth avoiding. For young people in good health, it poses less risk to you personally\u2014it\u2019s like HIV in that sense, very high survival rate of initial infection, with exceptions of course\u2014but you should still take care to not spread it to at-risk people. If you choose to go to a party or other crowded social function, that\u2019s your prerogative. But wait a few days (the \u2018official\u2019 recommendation is 14 days) after to make sure you haven\u2019t developed symptoms before visiting older people, babies, or anyone with a compromised immune system.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There is also reason to avoid COVID-19 simply because not much is known about its long-term effects. Many viruses, such as HPV and HIV, result in certain types of cancer. Surgeons have already seen the gastrointestinal effects of COVID-19, which include attacks on your digestive membranes and serious gut issues. For men, there is potential of the virus attacking the testicles and leading to infertility or decreased testosterone production. The virus may also damage the immune system, the heart, the respiratory system, and other organs. All things to consider in personal calculations of risk.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My main takeaway from this pandemic isn\u2019t that COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t have posed a serious threat to the country, but that America was particularly vulnerable because of its failure to address the high rates of preventable and reversible chronic disease among its populace. This is the biggest reason we couldn\u2019t adopt the pure Swedish model of herd immunity\u2014their population had the baseline health to make that work. Ours didn\u2019t.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is not to say that we chose the correct path. We didn\u2019t. But we need to understand why. It wasn\u2019t the President, who acted on the \u201Cbest\u201D advice given by the best and the brightest, who failed miserably. It was those very eggheads in the public health bureaucracy who gave him a menu of options that only included variations on turd sandwiches.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">They recommended an early focus on ventilator production, when the best doctors were saying that ventilators would just lead to more deaths. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. Patients were intubated before they needed to be, ventilators were often operated by nurses who had no trauma or ICU experience, and <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200422/most-covid-19-patients-placed-on-ventilators-died-new-york-study-shows#1\">many died as a result.</a> A 38-year-old man I knew died because the ventilator settings were too high and it blew out his lungs. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">They recommended lockdowns that were just strict enough to shut down the economy, but not strict enough to stop the disease. The CDC <a href=\"http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/0229/c90000-9663448.html\">stated publicly </a>that they \u201Cdid not recommend the use of facemasks'\u201C\u2014<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html\">and then reversed</a> and said that they needed to be mandatory and ascribed to them near-magical abilities despite the fact that most masks are too shoddy to take seriously.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">CDC and WHO officials spent January and February <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-04-20/h_267d4c445f4bf4730abca05eccc62c67\">complaining to the press</a> (as unnamed sources\u2013remember that bureaucrats crave relevance but not responsibility) that the President was overestimating the virus and his shutdown of flights from China was motivated by racial animus. Instead of rightly declaring excess body-fat as a public health crisis\u2014doctors <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/why-covid-19-more-deadly-people-obesity-even-if-theyre-young\">have said</a> that the number one non-respiratory risk factor for ventilator-dependence was BMI\u2014they declared racism was the real public health crisis. They ignored all evidence that the racial disparities in COVID-19 deaths had practical causes ranging from greater concentration in dense high-contact urban areas to melanin\u2019s blocking effect on vitamin D synthesis at northerly latitudes.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Even now, months into this pandemic, we are still waiting to hear the first mention of lifestyle change as a mitigation strategy by public health officials. In the six months since lockdown began, we could have moved millions of people from the high-risk to the low-risk categories simply through proper nutrition and exercise. We didn\u2019t. Not because we couldn\u2019t, but because the bureaucrats in charge of the response are rats.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/essential-lifter\"><em>[You Say Essential Worker, I Say \u2018Essential Lifter\u2019]</em></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">NIAID Director Anthony Fauci built a career on getting everything wrong about AIDS. CDC Director Robert Redfield <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/21/595812200/research-misconduct-allegations-shadow-new-cdc-director\">falsified data</a> in the early 90s to make it look like his vaccine candidate was preventing HIV infections. His assistant and accomplice was Dr. Deborah Birx. These are people who would be tarred and feathered in a more enlightened age for what they did, but due to the perverseness of our bureaucracy were promoted instead. When this is all over, I want show trials and public executions to send a strong message that this can never be allowed to happen again. And I want <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LokiJulianus\">Loki Julianus</a> to be named Public Health Czar, because from the very early days of this Pandemic, he has consistently gotten everything right.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Until that glorious day, we cannot rely on our leaders but only on ourselves. So here\u2019s your quick and dirty guide to fighting China Virus.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong><em>Author\u2019s note:</em></strong><em> I am by no means a health professional, merely an expert. This is what I do personally, not a medical prescription. Be sure to \u2018consult with a trusted doctor\u2019 before making lifestyle changes or taking new supplements.</em></p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No polyunsaturated fats. Get yourself a copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Nutrition-Your-Genes-Traditional/dp/1250113822\">Deep Nutrition</a> by Cate Shanahan and follow it religiously. No vegetable oil, no soybean oil, no canola oil, etc. Stick to grass-fed butter and tallow, coconut oil, olive oil, pastured lard. Elevated levels of unsaturated fats in the bloodstream of COVID-19 patients is <a href=\"https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/4/e01723-20\">strongly associated </a>with severity of the disease and can lead to multi-system organ failure including severe lung injury. It seems that when the virus attacks red blood cells, they liberate the heme iron ions which then react with unsaturated fats and oxidize. Literally rust in the veins. Early calcium and albumin supplementation also help with this.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Lots of sunshine. Not just for the Vitamin D, which cuts infection risk significantly, but also for nitric oxide production (lowers blood pressure) and the creation of other anti-pathogenic factors.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Boost your cholesterol intake to improve immunity. LDL cholesterol attaches to and inactivates viruses in the bloodstream. <a href=\"https://countere.com/home/raw-egg-nationalism\">Raw egg yolks</a> from pastured eggs are the best way to do this. Blend them up with some orange juice and cream for a nice Orange Julius, or read the <a href=\"https://independent.academia.edu/RawEggNationalist\">\u201CRAW EGG NATIONALIST COOKBOOK\u201D</a> for more recipes.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392107/\">Quercetin</a> &amp; zinc. This combo acts similarly to hydroxychloroquine but without needing a prescription. It treats autoimmune dysfunction which in turn will allow your immune system to identify infectious pathogens earlier.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7359418/\">N-acetyl-cysteine.</a> Replenishes glutathione in the lungs.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Daily aspirin. Helps with potential clotting issues, but is by no means a silver bullet. The National Institute of Health is currently trialing anticoagulant candidates. If you have Type A blood, I would monitor those results and try to obtain the most effective one, so you have it on hand in case you contract the virus. </p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Keep your upper respiratory tract in good shape. I have sinus issues but they are greatly lessened by using a <a href=\"https://www.manukaguard.com/products/sinus-cleanser\">Manuka Honey Sinus Cleaner</a> from ManukaGuard. This is your body\u2019s frontline defense against respiratory viruses.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sheep/goat colostrum and Thymus. Good for the lymphatic and immune systems.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sauna. The ones in gyms are mostly all still closed but you can make an infrared sauna at home fairly cheaply with a wooden frame covered with canvas and a bunch of brooder lights.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you don\u2019t already have a workout routine, a good starting point is to go on frequent long walks. It seems overly simple, but the health benefits are significant.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Lots of fresh, unpolluted air is essential. Get a good indoor air filter if you live in the city or somewhere crowded. If you\u2019re in the countryside, keep your windows open. I was introduced to this by German friend who would open all windows during the day even in winter. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwG0Dc2HaXg\">Sporadic cold exposure</a> is very good for your health, just take care to not overly chill yourself.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Avoid stress. Limit exposure to news and other forms of psychological warfare. Offer to make grocery runs and such for higher-risk people. Not only are you helping them, but doing nice things for people will make you feel good too. Feeling good and maintaining a positive and proactive mindset is what will carry you through this.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Read more of Benjamin Braddock\u2019s writing on </em><a href=\"https://benjaminbraddock.substack.com/\"><strong><em>Substack.</em></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

Most of the time this is what most consumers who buy grams get. This grade is difficult to sell in bulk though, because even your mildly savvy buyers will be aware that it is some bullshit.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The highest grade of cocaine is a beautiful shiny clay rock that we will call \u2018raw.\u2019 Typically the purity of raw is 80% to 97% pure. 80% raw typically was cut with amphetamines and/or levamisole (a deworming agent) before the cocaine paste was first compressed into rectangular 1-kilogram bricks in a South American jungle lab.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Raw \u2018bricks\u2019 of cocaine are <a href=\"https://genius.com/Gucci-mane-bricks-lyrics\">frequently referenced</a> in rap lyrics, and are stamped on one side, as opposed to heroin bricks which are often stamped on both sides (at least in my experience). I\u2019ve seen lots of swastikas stamped onto fresh bricks of raw cocaine, as well as an Audi symbol, Nintendo characters, random initials like RM, and the Donnie Darko bunny.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The margins of selling raw yiggity-yak are typically not so good because of a market inefficiency where the price of cocaine varies only slightly by purity; a raw ounce and some bullshit may easily both be $1200. I\u2019ve seen raw sold directly to consumers in a few places where cocaine is cheap and plentiful (like Miami); even in DC I knew a kid who would sell raw grams for $140 \u2014shiny little pebbles that their consumers would crush themselves.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What is an aspiring Tony Montana to do if he wants to boost his profit margin by cutting his product, but still have it be a shiny rock that flies off the proverbial shelves? The answer is that he needs to read this step-by-step guide to rerocking cocaine.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Rerocking cocaine is a method to cut cocaine while keeping it in rock form, as rock cocaine is more valuable than powder cocaine. Although rerocked cocaine isn\u2019t as soft or shiny as true raw rock cocaine, cutting cocaine and rerocking it is an indispensable tool for any player in the game.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604692989027_5582\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1200.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae39a6bd3f0f0c3c2ed8/1604693608308/inositol-rerock-cocaine\" alt=\"inositol-rerock-cocaine\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae39a6bd3f0f0c3c2ed8/1604693608308/inositol-rerock-cocaine\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae39a6bd3f0f0c3c2ed8/1604693608308/inositol-rerock-cocaine\" data-image-dimensions=\"1200x675\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"inositol-rerock-cocaine\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa5ae39a6bd3f0f0c3c2ed8\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604692989027_5871\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Step I</h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Once you\u2019ve acquired pure cocaine\u2014a far more difficult and treacherous endeavor than the rest of this process, and one you will need to figure out on your own\u2014you\u2019ll want to cut it. Go to a supplement store like GNC or Vitamin Shoppe to buy a liver health supplement called <a href=\"https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/source-naturals-pure-inositol-powder-4-oz-powder/sr-5932?mr%3AreferralID=NA&amp;mr%3AtrackingCode=DFF78696-0DBA-E911-8102-00505694403D&amp;store=566\">inositol</a> (pro-tip: it\u2019s twice as expensive at GNC). The inositol they sell on Amazon should be avoided no matter how cheap it is because it generally contains cellulose which is food for bacteria and it will turn your cocaine brown with a disgusting mold layer a couple days after you use it. I have seen this happen multiple times to people who ignored my advice. An alternative option is to use creatine, but inositol has a slightly better consistency for chopping drugs.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next decide how much weight (inositol) you want to add. This really depends on your clientele, but most people go with a 1:1 cut of inositol to cocaine. I only ever sold rerocked cocaine to lower dealers on the supply chain, many of whom were going to cut it some more, so I kept the quality high.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Put your inositol and cocaine in a coffee grinder reserved specifically for cutting drugs\u2014your coffee will not taste good if you grind coffee beans in it afterwards. At this point, you can also mix in a sprinkling of boric acid flakes to make the cocaine shinier, benzocaine and/or lidocaine to give the cocaine a numbing quality (no more than 1/8th of the total weight), and (a little bit of) amphetamines to give the cocaine more of a kick. After a minute or so in the grinder your cocaine will be a very fine powder.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/do-steroids-work-dark-iron-gains\"><em>[Controversial Opinion: Steroids Work]</em></a></p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604692989027_7823\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1200.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae476eff7b08f36f5a1f/1604693602459/acetone-rerock-cocaine.png\" alt=\"acetone-rerock-cocaine.png\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae476eff7b08f36f5a1f/1604693602459/acetone-rerock-cocaine.png\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa5ae476eff7b08f36f5a1f/1604693602459/acetone-rerock-cocaine.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1200x675\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"acetone-rerock-cocaine.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa5ae476eff7b08f36f5a1f\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604692989027_8112\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Step II</h3><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You now need to thoroughly spray your grinded cocaine with pure acetone so it sticks back together and becomes a rock again.

Not only is the guy one of the fastest living ultramarathon runners (check for yourself his 100-mile <a href=\"https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Michael&amp;lname=Arnstein\">times</a>), but he did it all while eating a fruit-only diet known as a \u2018fruitarian\u2019 diet. While veganism went mainstream in the last few years, fruitarianism has remained a fringe diet, yet one with a storied past. Everyone from Gandhi to Steve Jobs has experimented with fruitarianism; Arnstein is the most prolific athlete to adopt this lifestyle. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In order to fuel his controversial diet\u2014Ashton Kutcher landed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/28/ashton-kutcher-hospital-steve-jobs-diet\">in the hospital</a> after following Steve Jobs\u2019 fruitarianism\u2014Arnstein will typically purchase his fruits wholesale. Before moving to Hawaii in pursuit of natural and abundant produce, he had several refrigerators in his home in New York. When he\u2019s training, he can eat around 4000-6000 thousand calories a day\u2014bananas, grapes, blueberries, peaches, and more\u2014running over 200 miles a week. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Countere reached out to Arnstein and caught up with him at his Hawaiian home as he reflected on his past successes and prepares to tackle new personal records at the 100-mile distance in 2021. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>In your opinion, what is your most memorable ultramarathon run? </strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Most people don\u2019t know this about me but I DNF\u2019d (did not finish) my first <em>and</em> second 100-mile races. The first time I tried to run 100 miles I thought I was going to die, no kidding, I was scared. I had never felt that bad.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019ve got a friend who says if you're going to run a 100-mile race, and you train for it\u2014that\u2019s cheating. He\u2019s always about suffering. I\u2019m into it too. He wanted to start a 100-mile race that would ask people to sign a pledge saying that they wouldn\u2019t train for it. I love the idea. Peak suffering takes you to peak joy.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hmm\u2026but my greatest ever? It was when I won the <a href=\"https://vermont100.com/\">Vermont 100.</a> I did it in 15 hours and finished strong feeling even better at mile 100 than I did at the first mile. Then there was <a href=\"https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/Badwater_Ultramarathon\">Badwater Ultramarathon</a>, known as the 135-mile \u2018toughest race in the world\u2019.<em> </em>Man, running through Death Valley at 120 degrees, it was an amazing adventure. When I was a kid I used to wonder how it was possible for anyone to run a race like that\u2014and then to do it myself and kick ass? It\u2019s a great feeling. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>120 degrees in Death Valley? How did you prepare for something like that?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u2026I did a lot of running. But most importantly I ate fruit. A low-fat high-water diet. And no one else really did that. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you carry less fat, you need less energy to propel your body through the desert. You need less water to cool yourself. It\u2019s all physics. Look at fat people when they are in a long hallway and its 70 degrees\u2014they start sweating. They basically have a full coat on. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The cars that can go the fastest weigh the least. Anything with fiberglass moves faster than steel. Same as a human body.

If you want the best quality of food, you need to spend money. Most ultra-marathon runners and people in long-distance sports don\u2019t make a ton of money. You can perform well on a high-fat diet\u2014it\u2019s proven\u2014but it\u2019s not good for your long-term health and it also compromises your immune system.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fruits and vegetables aren\u2019t just about calories\u2014they are medicine. You can get by on bread, but you won\u2019t thrive on it, and if you care about the environment at all, you need fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Cooking food takes a lot of energy. So, if you're at all tied into animal rights, but you\u2019re still eating animals, then you\u2019re just unconscious about your decisions in life. It is important to see fruits as not just for performance but for karma. It is the food we were designed to eat.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/raw-egg-nationalism\"><em>[I Ate the Favorite Foods of Trump, Putin, &amp; Kim Jong Un]</em></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>It\u2019s been said that if you eat fruit your blood will clot slower. What\u2019s been the most surprising health effect you\u2019ve seen from your diet?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Overall, if you're not eating fruits and vegetables\u2014you're not respecting your health. There will be consequences and you do not want to go down that road. When I eat all fruits, I\u2019m kicking ass, I don\u2019t know what depression is, I don\u2019t have body odor, I don\u2019t get injured. It\u2019s all diet, man. People don\u2019t know what they are missing. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m not always 100% fruitarian. But I hate waking up in the morning feeling like \u201CWhat the hell did I just do to myself?\u201D It\u2019s unbelievable the difference between eating clean and eating what you\u2019ve been sold as healthy.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>When I tried to be a fruitarian I felt like a pariah among my friends. How do you balance personal commitments with social demands?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's a personal choice. You can say \u201CLook, I will do it seasonally.\u201D If it\u2019s winter, I won\u2019t beat myself up for eating starch. But I made a personal choice\u2014I moved to Hawaii and now have good fruit all year round. Because if I eat some potatoes, it snowballs into potato chips and then I\u2019m like \u201CDamn, what happened?\u201D So you have to know your limits. I can\u2019t casually have a cigar or pizza or marijuana. I don\u2019t want to go down that road. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Do you have a doctor?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No, man\u2026that\u2019s like saying \u201CI need a lawyer because I\u2019m scared someone will sue me!\u201D People are delusional. Doctors are there to enable your bad habits if you\u2019re sick, because you made stupid lifestyle choices\u2014change them.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Does your family share your diet?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s funny, I like to lead by example. I tell my kids if they are sick to notice that Dad never gets sick. It\u2019s not just luck.

With COVID-19, all the races were canceled this year. I had a full schedule lined up but it\u2019s all been wiped out. So I wrote 2020 off. I\u2019m down to running 50-100 miles a week right now.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In life, there are many different races. The race I\u2019m currently most focused on is the financial race\u2014improving my long-term stability outside of athletics. I\u2019m focused on putting hours in at work; hopefully, other people are doing the same. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But I recently went to Colorado for a week and did 25 hours of running just as a way to remember what it was like to train hard. I think I\u2019ll come back harder in 2021. The time off\u2014who knows?\u2014is probably good for all of us.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>How has going from 180-210 miles a week to only 50-100 affected your mindset? </strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I don\u2019t<em> </em>like exercising less. A lot of people look at ultramarathon runners with awe but in my mind, it\u2019s a sad reminder of how out of shape people are. I have a dog and he weighs 12 pounds. He can run 30 miles as long as it\u2019s not too hot out. During the fall months, he wags his tail from mile 1 to mile 30 and doesn\u2019t think about it\u2014he\u2019s just built to do it. Humans are so pathetically out of shape that the idea of running 10 miles is absurd to most people. If you tell most people in NYC that they need to walk 20 blocks they decide to hail a taxi...I don\u2019t even want to think like that.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019d love to go back to 150-mile weeks. That\u2019s what we\u2019re built to do. We were designed to be on two feet, moving all day every day, and that\u2019s why this pandemic is wiping out most people\u2014we are so sick, so weak, we can\u2019t <a href=\"https://countere.com/home/1969-hong-kong-flu\">handle any viruses,</a> and it\u2019s sad.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>The idea of eating only fruit to most people is absurd. Do you see a way to introduce the fruitarian diet to mainstream society?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sadly, the conspiracy theory of big companies controlling everything is kind of true. I don\u2019t usually look at the cup half-empty, but if we look at the history of humanity, we have gone backwards health-wise. People are living longer but it\u2019s based on taking drugs. For all the progress, the amount of drugs written for blood pressure and heart disease is worse than ever. Meanwhile, I\u2019m eating fruit and running up mountains. The funny thing is, in the mountains, no one\u2019s there. Everyone\u2019s behind a desk hating their lives, their jobs. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We\u2019ve gotten too far away from the essentials of diet and lifestyle. The big problem with fruit is that it\u2019s perishable. You need to be wealthy enough to have a few refrigerators. So you don\u2019t need to be 100% fruit, but I hope the truth will prevail and people come around. The better habits you have, the more success you will have, and your greatest asset is your health. If you don\u2019t have it, you have nothing.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Michael Arnstein is the Founder of the Woodstock Fruit Festival, which you can check out on their </em><a href=\"http://thewoodstockfruitfestival.com/\"><strong><em>website.</em></strong></a><strong><em>\uFEFF</em></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

I\u2019ve dabbled in financially dominating men, I\u2019ve had \u2018fans\u2019 buy me gifts from my <a href=\"https://www.revolve.com/content/favorites/s/10062092?departmentFilter=Women\">Revolve wish list,</a> I\u2019ve gotten wannabe sugar daddies to PayPal me to show me they\u2019re for real. Once a guy sent me an unsolicited dick pic and I told him if he didn\u2019t send me money to apologize, I\u2019d be blocking him. He claimed he didn\u2019t have PayPal or Venmo, but he was able to buy me some books off my Amazon wish list.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m not ashamed. I was a broke writer working a zillion side hustles. If a random dude on the internet wanted my time, he was going to have to make it worth my while.&nbsp;To be fair, I usually told myself I'd consider them if they sent money, but at the end of the day I usually felt too weird to ever continue the conversation.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As I\u2019ve gotten older and my paychecks bigger, I\u2019ve become less interested in treating simps like a side hustle. I\u2019m making a lot more money at work and already find myself barely being able to respond to DMs from my actual friends. (I realize this is a good problem to have, but still.)</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are still random thirsty dudes in my DMs chatting as if we\u2019re old pals, so I figured it would be an interesting experiment to send them my PayPal link. At best, I\u2019d get some cash, and at worst I\u2019d have guys stop sending me a zillion \u201Cheys\u201D in a row because they now think I\u2019m a bad, greedy person\u2014right?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Here\u2019s what happened.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">First, I sent 15 guys who had DM\u2019d me on Instagram my PayPal link with no other message, just to see how they\u2019d react. Unfortunately, I found that most guys asked a follow-up question, such as \u201Chow much should I send?\u201D or \u201Care we going to meet up?\u201D One guy asked if I had gotten hacked. Some guys completely ignored my link and literally just sent their original message again.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A lot of guys are clued in to the fact that women want money for their time these days, and they try to get around that by promising hard cash and then just stalling. One dude who DM\u2019d me begging me to \u201Ctake his $\u201D still never sent shit when I actually provided him with my PayPal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No one sent any money though. This meant that I still had to have a conversation with them pre-deposit, which is what I was trying to avoid. So, I tried sending the next 15 guys the following message:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hi! Welcome to Ashley's DMs! Please pay the DM tax to continue chatting <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ashleyuzer\">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ashleyuzer</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This put hard brakes on a lot of the conversations, because guys realized I was actually demanding money to talk to them. They could just choose to move along to the next <a href=\"http://loxandleather.com/2018/03/23/how-wear-crazy-bikinis-without-crazy-tan-lines/\">bikini-clad girl</a> on Instagram. However, some still ignored my request and kept sending me DMs or emoji replies to my stories. One even claimed he had \u201Csomething big coming to me\u201D (whatever that means), but then just kept trying to chat. He eventually told me that he couldn\u2019t make a substantial donation until he sorts things out with his ex. Hey, I respect the honesty.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Out of all the guys I sent my PayPal too, only one man got defensive and angry, and that was probably only because I actually responded to one of his later messages. I really thought more would lash out, so good for men.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604683296540_5934\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:1656.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:108.21255493164062%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa586b0869fdc084ee67fdc/1604683447765/paypal-tax-dms\" alt=\"paypal-tax-dms\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa586b0869fdc084ee67fdc/1604683447765/paypal-tax-dms\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa586b0869fdc084ee67fdc/1604683447765/paypal-tax-dms\" data-image-dimensions=\"1656x1792\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"paypal-tax-dms\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa586b0869fdc084ee67fdc\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604683296540_6223\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">By the way, I didn\u2019t actually believe the guy above was going to \u201Cblindly send me money.\u201D I\u2019ve been in the game long enough to know that any guy who asks \u201Chow much\u201D is just trying to divert the conversation longer so he can continue fapping before having to pay up.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Setting up a DM Tax didn\u2019t yield any money.

Instagram doesn\u2019t exactly make it easy to monetize all the rando dudes asking \u201Ccan we talk?\u201D in your DMs, but there are apps for that. OnlyFans is the first app that comes to mind, but they recently set a $50 limit on transactions and a $100 limit on tips, allegedly due to<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/onlyfans-limit-tips-after-bella-thorne-earned-1m-2020-8\"> Bella Thorne\u2019s big payout</a> the other week. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you\u2019re a sex worker of any kind and looking to make money through chatting with your fans, you might want to check out a newer monetization platform called <a href=\"https://foxy.co/whyfoxy\">Foxy</a> instead. If you don\u2019t identify as a sex worker and are more interested in charging your followers for private chats on dating advice, Instagram tips, or whatever else, you should check out another new app called<a href=\"https://mysalut.com/\"> Salut</a>. It\u2019s like a mix between Patreon and Telegram in that it\u2019s built like a chat &amp; social media hybrid app, but with a bunch of monetization methods built so you don\u2019t have to awkwardly send your followers your PayPal in the midst of things getting serious.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On the consumer side, I would recommend <a href=\"https://www.sextpanther.com/\">Sextpanther</a> for sexting because it\u2019s a platform built for sexting with your favorite adult stars &amp; cam girls.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As for me, I don\u2019t see myself soliciting money from men on Instagram again in the near future. Not because I\u2019m above it, but because I am simply too burnt out on social media to begin with, and I don\u2019t have the social skills to pretend I give a fuck.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Follow Ashley Uzer on </em><a href=\"http://instagram.com/ashleygiov\"><strong><em>Instagram.</em></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

I have a wide variety of friends, both personal and colleagues in media and academics. I enjoy a friendly debate here and there on political issues, hip-hop, or sports. It\u2019s rare that I remember a Facebook argument but there was one that always stuck with me.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In 2016 Bob Dylan was awarded the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2016/summary/#:~:text=The%20Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature%202016%20was%20awarded%20to%20Bob,the%20great%20American%20song%20tradition.%22\">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> \u201Cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\u201D As a long-time fan of his, I was pretty happy about this. When acclaimed author <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/10/18/a-reckoning-is-different-than-a-tell-all-an-interview-with-kiese-laymon/\">Kiese Leymon</a> posted on Facebook that Dylan did not deserve the prize, I posted&nbsp;a comment disagreeing with him, touting Dylan\u2019s long history of social commentary and dedication to the civil rights movement.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Out of the blue, I was verbally attacked by someone with a peculiar Facebook name: Jess La Bombalera. She claimed that Dylan was \u201Can old irrelevant white man\u201D who had nothing to do with the modern-day protests in the streets. She told me that the kids protesting in the streets weren\u2019t playing Dylan but Future and Migos, who were more relevant to the protests. She said that the Nobel Prize should have gone to a woman of color.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I tried to defend Dylan by pointing out that he had made songs like \u201CBlowing In The Wind\u201D and \u201CThe Times They Are a-Changin\u2019\u201D that directly relate to the situation today, and that Dylan had addressed police brutality and racial profiling on his song \u201CHurricane.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Jess La Bombalera took this as an opportunity to attack me personally. I wasn\u2019t a \u201Creal revolutionary person of color\u201D if I respected an old irrelevant white man like Bob Dylan. I told her my background\u2014that my father was a Black man from Jamaica, that my mother was a white anti-apartheid activist from South Africa. She then attributed my respect for Dylan to my whiteness and questioned my white mother\u2019s motives fighting apartheid in South Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She went on to try to out-Black me by telling me how many Black Lives Matter protests she had attended. She asked me how many protests I had taken part in. When I told her \u201Cnone\u201D\u2014that I was a journalist and author who wrote the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inside-CIAs-Secret-War-Jamaica/dp/1944082077\">\u201CInside the CIA\u2019s Secret War in Jamaica\u201D</a> and wrote protest music\u2014she trashed my book and music as being irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/whiteleftists\"><em>[How the CIA Helped Create the First Mexican Cartel: On Amazon\u2019s \u201CThe Last Narc\u201D]</em></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s not often that I check a person\u2019s page during a disagreement on Facebook, but I had to find out who this person was. Who had the audacity to question my Blackness?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Jess La Bombalera had some sort of revolutionary symbol as her profile picture. I\u2019d never met a Latina woman who was called Jess. They would usually go by Jessica. I\u2019d also never heard of any Latinos calling themselves \u2018La Bombalera\u2019\u2014it seemed like a wrestling name that an upper-class white girl from Scarsdale would use.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On her page, I found out Jess La Bombalera\u2019s real name: Jessica Krug. I saw a picture where she looked like a white Jewish woman with a tan. As a biracial man with many biracial friends, I have a good eye for identifying my biracial brothers and sisters. She wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When I Googled her last name \u2018Krug,\u2019 I didn\u2019t find any \u2018Afro-Latinas\u2019 but Ashkenazi Jews. The picture, the last name, and her overcompensating for Blackness let me know one thing. This woman was not Black. Not Latina, not even biracial. This was a full-fledged white woman.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604683142401_5425\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-site-default\n          individual-animation-site-default\n          individual-text-animation-site-default\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:714.0px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n                style=\"padding-bottom:66.66667175292969%;\"\n              \n              class=\"\n                image-block-wrapper\n                \n          \n        \n                has-aspect-ratio\n              \"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <noscript><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa585c9b0e9794ee6b5f738/1604850267391/\" alt=\"White Jessica Krug vs. \u2018Black\u2019 Jessica Krug.\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa585c9b0e9794ee6b5f738/1604850267391/\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f9f625ebb288273ba51c6ec/t/5fa585c9b0e9794ee6b5f738/1604850267391/\" data-image-dimensions=\"714x476\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"White Jessica Krug vs. \u2018Black\u2019 Jessica Krug.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5fa585c9b0e9794ee6b5f738\" data-type=\"image\" />\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"sqsrte-large\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">White Jessica Krug vs. \u2018Black\u2019 Jessica Krug.</p></div>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604683142401_5714\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I called her out on it and told her she wasn\u2019t a person of color. She claimed that she was 100% Afro-Latina and derided me for being half-white. At this point Kiese Leymons threatened to delete the thread over fear of a racial identity war.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not only had I been attacked by Jessica Krug for being a sellout for liking Bob Dylan, but a group of other people had chimed in to defend her and attack me. It seemed like Krug had some influence on prominent Black and Latinx academics.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n40wEIFtImU\">Here she is</a> testifying to NYC City Council in July 2020 in full, glorious Ebonics.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">After that, I would see Krug post a lot of anti-white content on people\u2019s posts in the Black academic community. I wouldn\u2019t interact with her in fear of being bullied by her and her online followers.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Still, I would be baited into debating her once again\u2014this time defending a Pulitzer Prize winner. When acclaimed author Junot D\u00EDaz was accused of sexual misconduct, Krug was one of his most vocal critics.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I saw Krug bashing D\u00EDaz on several pages of our mutual friends as a rapist and sexist.&nbsp;D\u00EDaz had been accused of kissing author Zinzi Clemmons without solicitation. D\u00EDaz denied kissing her, yet Krug used this allegation to deride Diaz as a rapist.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I agree that unsolicited touching is a terrible thing, but I thought that D\u00EDaz was getting lumped in with sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby for misreading signals. I believe the situation should have been transformed into a teachable moment about unwanted touching and nonverbal signals\u2014not a cancellation of one the few voices of the Latino-American community that speaks up for the poor and disenfranchised.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When I defended Diaz, Krug attacked me for being sexist, defending a rapist (D\u00EDaz was never accused of rape), and being just as bad as the \u2018white male patriarchy.\u2019 When I said that D\u00EDaz did a lot for the Latino community through donating time and literature, she told me that his work was sexist, did not represent the Latino community, and like Bob Dylan with the Nobel, did not deserve the Pulitzer Prize.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now the world knows what I have known all along. On September 3, Jessica Krug wrote a Medium post titled <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessakrug/the-truth-and-the-anti-black-violence-of-my-lies-9a9621401f85\">\u201CThe Truth, and the Anti-Black Violence of My Lies.\u201D</a> She revealed she had been posing as an Afro-Latina Black woman her entire life, disguising her true identity as a wealthy suburban Jewish white woman from Kansas City. Furthermore, her Medium post doesn\u2019t seem to be the result of a guilty conscience, but rather an attempt to \u2018get ahead\u2019 of the story after several university students <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrYoFiggy/status/1301602923026284551\">began questioning</a> her Blackness.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Krug didn\u2019t just antagonize me. Since her admission, <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/1422412/white-professor-jessica-krug-earliest-memories-police-violence/\">countless stories</a> have surfaced of her screaming \u201Cwhite trash\u201D at joggers, stealing her white neighbors\u2019 packages and then trying to goad them into calling the police\u2014no doubt for more \u2018oppression points\u2019 and maybe a viral video\u2014and threatening to \u201Cstomp\u201D on a tiny black poodle. One student on <a href=\"https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1806264\">RateMyProfessors</a> said that \"If you ask her the history about WWII, Nazi Germany, Cold War, or something like those, she will only answer you the history about the Caribbeans and Africa.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It gets worse. A video recently surfaced of Krug at a Columbia University panel (the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;t=807&amp;v=RFrd5v01hMg\">full video</a> has been removed by Columbia, although an edit remains online <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CountereCulture/status/1303346112414257152\">here</a>) romanticizing the brutal <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/09/09/jessica-krug-denigrated-death-of-bronx-teen-junior-guzman-feliz/\">machete murder </a>of 15-year-old Lesandro \u2018Junior\u2019 Guzman-Feliz. Even though Guzman\u2019s death at the hands of gang members was a case of mistaken identity, Krug seems to justify his death due to his involvement in the NYPD Explorers\u2014a youth program I\u2019ve seen up close in the Bronx that helps Black and brown kids avoid gangs and trouble.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u201C[Junior] was an Explorer, which is a program that the NYPD has to bring youth in to eventually work for them,\u201D Krug said. \u201CWhen people talk about \u2018snitches get stitches\u2019...that kind of violence towards people who are collaborating or working against their communities, we have to consider a radical moment in 2018 in which people are using machetes to hack apart a 15-year-old boy who\u2019s working with the police.\u201D</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Krug continued: \u201CThe loss of innocence is the story we mourn, and it\u2019s so much more difficult to understand what kind of freedom we could achieve by being willing to confront those who are working against the interests of the community.\u201D Applause.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://countere.com/home/whiteleftists\"><em>[The Danger of White Leftists]</em></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No wonder Krug was so triggered by Bob Dylan. Perhaps her white mother played him in her house a lot and in order to reject her whiteness and become Black, she had to disown Dylan. To show how pro-Latina she was, she had to lead the Facebook charge to cancel Junot D\u00EDaz. In order to show her Blackness, she had to diminish mine.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fuck Jessica Krug. She is a piece of shit who used a fake Black identity to shit on other Black people and question their identity when she knew she was a complete fraud.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I\u2019m just disappointed in my Black academic colleagues for accepting someone who was so obviously fraudulent for such a long time. They must be held accountable too\u2014was her self-hating anti-white talk the only prerequisite to being accepted as a Black intellectual? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Krug\u2019s 2018 book <em>Fugitive Modernities </em>was a finalist for the Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman book prizes. She wrote for <em>Essence</em>. She was a tenured professor. The truly terrifying thing is that Jessica Krug had real influence on the way Black and Latino people think.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To me, Krug is way worse than Rachel Dolezal. Krug not only pretended to be Black, but purposefully caused tension between Blacks and whites\u2014trying to get Black people to hate white people as much as she did, when she really just hated herself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So fuck Jessica Krug and everybody like her. Krug owes me an apology, she owes Junot D\u00EDaz an apology, and she owes Bob Dylan an apology. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Follow Casey Gane-McCalla on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyGane\"><strong><em>Twitter.</em></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",
